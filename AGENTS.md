# Hoho Design System Freeze V1

Hoho Design System V1 is the project's formal and frozen visual baseline.
The reference implementation is the production-approved `/health-events` page,
the `--hoho-*` tokens in `src/styles/tokens.css`, and the components in
`src/components/design-system/`.

- New pages and components must use `--hoho-*` tokens and existing Design System components first.
- Do not define a parallel primary color, typography scale, spacing scale, radius, shadow, button, card, tag, input, modal or timeline style inside a page.
- If a reusable visual capability is missing, extend `components/design-system/` and document it. An extension must be reusable in at least two product contexts and contain no health business logic.
- Do not introduce another UI framework, replace the Design System, or globally redesign the product without explicit user authorization.
- Do not change a frozen page's information architecture or interaction flow while performing visual work.
- A local page request changes only the explicitly named surface; all other product surfaces remain frozen.
- Health event hierarchy is frozen: the list page emphasizes year/date/event summary, while the detail page emphasizes exact time and health fact changes. Shared visual language must not erase this distinction.
- Avoid dashboard density, card nesting, decorative badges, large tinted blocks and nonessential elevation. Sections are flat by default; cards are reserved for important surfaces.
- Hoho is a mobile-first web product. Do not add native-app navigation patterns or unrelated app chrome.
- Backend, API, data, AI/parser, HealthFact and time-resolution changes must stay behind their existing boundaries and must not be made as part of visual migration.

Illustration artwork such as virtual-avatar skin, hair and clothing palettes is an asset-level exception; those colors are not UI tokens.

See `docs/hoho-design-system-v1.md` for the component and token contract and `docs/ui-freeze-v1.md` for the review checklist.

## Impeccable 使用规则

Hoho Design System V1 已冻结。

Impeccable 默认只能用于：

- audit
- critique
- polish
- distill
- responsive refinement
- spacing / hierarchy / alignment / typography refinement
- accessibility and UI anti-pattern review

除非用户明确要求，否则禁止使用 Impeccable：

- redesign 整个页面
- 创建新的视觉体系
- 更换 Hoho Design System V1
- 修改主色、Typography Scale、Radius、Shadow 基线
- 引入新的 UI Framework
- 改变冻结的信息架构和业务交互

所有 Impeccable 优化必须：

1. 先读取 Hoho Design System V1；
2. 读取目标页面当前实现；
3. 保留现有产品视觉语言；
4. 只修改用户明确授权的范围。

原则：Impeccable 是 Hoho 的“设计审计和精修工具”，不是新的设计系统。

## Health time semantics

- Health event and health record occurrence times represent facts that already happened or are happening now.
- Every write of `startTime` or `occurredAt` must enforce `value <= current time` in both the UI and the server API.
- The server is authoritative: future values must fail validation before persistence or AI Parser/Organization processing.
- Compare instants after ISO 8601 parsing so client and server timezone differences do not change the rule.
## Hoho Health Chronology

- Health timelines and health-record lists default to newest first.
- The stable ordering contract is `occurredAt DESC -> createdAt DESC -> id DESC`.
- This contract applies to event detail timelines, same-day records, temperature, medication, visit, examination, status-change and backfilled history displays.
- Backfilled history is positioned by its actual `occurredAt`; a newer `createdAt` must not move an older occurrence above more recent health records.
- Year navigation lists only years that contain events and orders them newest to oldest.
- Do not substitute `createdAt` or `updatedAt` for `occurredAt` when displaying or ordering health chronology.

## Email verification authentication release strategy

- While Hoho is not formally open to external users, email verification authentication may use the rapid Production iteration flow: automated verification -> commit -> push -> Production deployment -> online acceptance.
- Before a Production deployment, `RESEND_API_KEY`, `AUTH_EMAIL_FROM`, and `AUTH_TOKEN_SECRET` must be configured as Production environment-scoped secrets and must never be committed or printed in logs.
- `AUTH_EMAIL_FROM` must be an actual sender allowed by the configured Resend account. Do not guess or deploy an unverified sender.
- Once the user explicitly announces that unknown or formal external users are using Hoho, switch to the Staging-first release gate: development -> isolated Staging -> real-email acceptance -> Production.
- Keep the existing Railway Staging environment available. The rapid Production mode does not delete or weaken Staging; it only makes Staging optional during the current internal-use phase.
